    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>

    <p>
      This is my first <b> paragraph </b> in my new <i>webpage</i>. This is
      going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain
      <b>myself.</b> Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create
      web pages is easy and <b>entertaining</b>. This is my second
      <em>paragraph </em> . I hope you like it.
